# dea_real_state
This is a project about a data set provide by Great Learning and University of Texas at Austin about Real State in Australia , it has 27114 rows and 16 columns. It is not Big Data but it is one of my first aproches to a proper data analysis. 
The approach to the DEA: 
- Sanity check
- Univariate Analysis 
- Bivariate Analysis 
- Missing Value Treatment 
- Outlier Detection and Treatment
