# dea_real_state
Not finished


This is a project about a data set provide by Great Learning and University of Texas at Austin about Real State in Australia , it has 27114 rows and 16 columns. It is not Big Data but it is one of my first aproches to a proper data analysis. 

The approach to the DEA: 
- Sanity check
- Univariate Analysis (includes Sanity check)
- Bivariate Analysis (includes Univaariate Analysis)
- Missing Value Treatment (includes Bivariate Analysis)
- Outlier Detection and Treatment (includes Missing Value Treatment)
- Conclusions 

I will upload for parts if you want to focus just in a specific aspect of the data exploratory analysis
