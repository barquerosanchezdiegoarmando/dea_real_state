Not finished


This is a data analysis project about a data set provided by Great Learning and University of Texas at Austin about Real State in Australia, Melbourne , it has 27114 rows and 16 columns. It is not Big Data but it is one of my first aproches to a proper data analysis. 

The approach to the DEA: 
- Sanity check
- Univariate Analysis (includes Sanity check)
- Bivariate Analysis (includes Univariate Analysis)
- Missing Value Treatment (includes Bivariate Analysis)
- Outlier Detection and Treatment + conclusions (includes Missing Value Treatment) 
- Causability check in r and py (includes Outlier Detection and Treatment + conclusions)

I will upload for parts if you want to focus just in a specific aspect of the data exploratory analysis
